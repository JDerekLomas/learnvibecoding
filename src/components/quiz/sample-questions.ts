      'Find a common denominator (12). Convert: 8/12 + 3/12 = 11/12. If you chose 3/7, you added numerators and denominators separately. If you chose 3/12, you only converted one fraction.',

    question: 'You want AI to build a login page for your SaaS app. Which prompt will get the best result?',

    explanation:
      'Claude Code can read your files directly — pointing it to the relevant ones gives it real context without noise. Describing everything manually is error-prone and slow. Letting it guess leads to wrong assumptions. package.json shows dependencies but not how your app is structured.',

    question: 'Claude generated an API route that takes user input and runs: `db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = \'" + name + "\'")`. What\'s the problem?',
    correctAnswer: 'SQL injection — user input is directly concatenated into the query string',

      'The single quotes should be double quotes',

      'Concatenating user input directly into SQL queries allows attackers to inject malicious SQL. Use parameterized queries instead. While SELECT * and missing indexes are real concerns, they\'re performance issues, not security vulnerabilities. Quote style is irrelevant here.',

    title: 'Understanding React State',
    question: 'This React code doesn\'t update the UI when clicked:\n\n`let count = 0;\nconst handleClick = () => { count++; };`\n\nWhy?',
    correctAnswer: 'Regular variables don\'t trigger re-renders — you need useState to make React update the UI',
    distractors: [
      'The variable should be declared with const instead of let',
      'handleClick needs to be wrapped in useCallback',

    explanation:
      'React only re-renders when state (via useState/useReducer) or props change. A plain variable changing doesn\'t tell React anything happened. const would make it unassignable. useCallback is for memoization, not reactivity. forceUpdate is a class component escape hatch, not the solution.',

    question: 'Claude wrote: `for (let i = 0; i <= arr.length; i++)` to loop through an array. What\'s wrong?',
    correctAnswer: 'It should be i < arr.length — using <= goes one past the end and will access undefined',

      'Nothing is wrong, this is correct',
      'It should start at i = 1',

    explanation:
      'Arrays are zero-indexed, so valid indices are 0 to length-1. Using <= accesses index === length, which is undefined and could cause bugs. Starting at 1 would skip the first element. forEach is a valid alternative but doesn\'t fix the bug — the question is about identifying the error.',

    correctAnswer: 'If the request fails or returns a non-200 status, r.json() will either throw or return error HTML parsed as JSON, crashing the app',
    distractors: [
      'Nothing — fetch handles errors automatically',
      'The await is unnecessary since .then() already handles the promise',
      'You need to use axios instead of fetch for error handling',
    ],
    explanation:
      'fetch doesn\'t throw on HTTP errors (404, 500) — it only throws on network failures. You need to check response.ok before parsing. The await is needed to get the final value from the .then() chain. axios isn\'t required — fetch works fine with proper error checking.',

    title: 'Choosing the Right AI Tool',
    question: 'You need to add a feature to an existing codebase with 50+ files. Which tool is best?',

    distractors: [
      'ChatGPT web — paste the files you think are relevant into the chat',
      'Cursor — it only works for small projects',
      'Write it manually — AI can\'t handle existing codebases',
    ],
    explanation:
      'Claude Code can explore your full codebase, read files, understand dependencies, and make precise edits. Pasting files into ChatGPT loses project context and structure.

      'git push, git commit, git add',
      'git commit, git push',
      'git save, git upload',
    ],
    explanation:
      'Git has a staging workflow: add (stage files) → commit (save a snapshot locally) → push (upload to remote). You can\'t push before committing, and you can\'t commit without adding. There are no "save" or "upload" commands in git.',

    question: 'You cloned a repo and ran `npm start` but got errors about missing modules. What should you do first?',

      'Delete the project and clone it again',
      'Manually download each missing module from npm\'s website',
      'Run npm update to get the latest versions of everything',
    ],
    explanation:
      'node_modules is gitignored (it\'s huge). After cloning, you need npm install to download dependencies listed in package.json. Re-cloning won\'t help since node_modules still won\'t be there. npm update changes versions, which could introduce breaking changes.',

    difficulty: 'proficient',
    title: 'Environment Variables',
    question: 'Your app needs an API key. Where should you put it?',
    correctAnswer: 'In a .env file that\'s listed in .gitignore, and set as an environment variable in your deployment platform',
    distractors: [
      'Hardcode it in your JavaScript file — it\'s the simplest approach',
      'Put it in a comment in your code so you remember it',
      'Store it in package.json under a "secrets" field',
    ],
    explanation:
      'API keys should never be in code or version control. .env files + .gitignore keeps them out of git. Deployment platforms (Vercel, Netlify) have their own environment variable settings. Hardcoding, comments, or package.json all expose secrets in your git history.',

    distractors: [
      'It builds locally and uploads the built files',
